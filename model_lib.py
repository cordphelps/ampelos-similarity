    # perplexity
    # To preprocess sentence-based data for Groq or any machine learning model, you need to transform 
    # the raw text into a structured format that can be fed into the model. Below is a step-by-step 
    # guide based on common NLP preprocessing techniques:

    # Sentence Segmentation
        # from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
        # text = "Hello world! This is a test sentence. NLP preprocessing is useful."
        # sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
        # print(sentences)
        # # Output: ['Hello world!', 'This is a test sentence.', 'NLP preprocessing is useful.']

    # Tokenization (Split sentences into individual words (tokens).)
        # from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
        # sentence = "Hello, world! NLP preprocessing is fun."
        # tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)
        # print(tokens)
        # # Output: ['Hello', ',', 'world', '!', 'NLP', 'preprocessing', 'is', 'fun', '.']

    # Lowercasing (Ensures consistency and reduces vocabulary size.)
        # tokens = [token.lower() for token in tokens]
        # print(tokens)
        # # Output: ['hello', ',', 'world', '!', 'nlp', 'preprocessing', 'is', 'fun', '.']


    # Stop Word Removal (Reduces noise and focuses on meaningful words.)
        # stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
        # filtered_tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stop_words]
        # print(filtered_tokens)
        # # Output: ['hello', ',', 'world', '!', 'nlp', 'preprocessing', 'fun', '.']

    
    # Punctuation Removal
        # import string
        # filtered_tokens = [token for token in filtered_tokens if token not in string.punctuation]
        # print(filtered_tokens)
        # # Output: ['hello', 'world', 'nlp', 'preprocessing', 'fun']

    
    # Stemming/Lemmatization (Reduces vocabulary size and improves generalization.)
        # from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
        # stemmer = PorterStemmer()
        # stemmed_tokens = [stemmer.stem(token) for token in filtered_tokens]
        # print(stemmed_tokens)
        # # Output: ['hello', 'world', 'nlp', 'preprocess', 'fun']

    
    # Text Normalization (Canonicalize informal text (e.g., “u” → “you”, “real-time” → “realtime”) to ensure consistency)
        # Use custom rules or libraries like `textblob`.

    
    # Vectorization (Convert text to numerical representation
        # from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
        # vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
        # vectorized_data = vectorizer.fit_transform([" ".join(stemmed_tokens)])
        # print(vectorized_data.toarray())
        # # Output: [[1 1 1 1 1]] (example representation of token counts)

    

    # 
    return("done")


def compare_vectorized_data(df):

    # perplexity
    # to compare vectorized data for similarity using Groq, you can leverage embedding vectors 
    # and compute similarity metrics, such as cosine similarity, which is commonly used in machine 
    # learning and NLP tasks. Here’s how this process can be structured:
    
    
    # 1. Preprocessing Data into Vectors
    # Before comparing data, you need to convert your text or other input data into vector 
    # representations (embeddings). Groq supports embeddings through integration with frameworks 
    # like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

        # from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
        # # Load a pre-trained embedding model
        # model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
        # # Convert sentences to vectors
        # sentences = ["This is a test sentence.", "Another example sentence."]
        # vectors = model.encode(sentences)
        # print(vectors)
        # # Output: Array of vectors representing the sentences

    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    sentences = ["This is a test sentence.", "Another example sentence."]
    

    # 2. Store Vectors in a Vector Database
    # Groq can integrate with vector databases like Pinecone to store and efficiently retrieve 
    # vectors for similarity comparisons. Pinecone allows you to index and query vectorized data.

        # import pinecone
        # # Initialize Pinecone
        # pinecone.init(api_key="your-pinecone-api-key", environment="us-west1-gcp")
        # # Create an index
        # index = pinecone.Index("example-index")
        # # Store vectors in the index
        # for i, vector in enumerate(vectors):
        #     index.upsert([(f"id-{i}", vector)])

    # 3. Compute Similarity Between Vectors
    # To determine similarity between vectors, you can compute a metric such as cosine similarity. 
    # This measures the angle between two vectors in high-dimensional space.

        # from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
        # # Compute cosine similarity between two vectors
        # similarity = cosine_similarity([vectors[0]], [vectors[1]])
        # print(similarity)
        # # Output: [[0.85]] (example similarity score)

    # 4. Use Groq for Fast Inference
    # Groq’s hardware accelerates the inference process by leveraging its Language Processing Units (LPUs). 
    # Once the embeddings are generated and stored, Groq can be used to efficiently compute similarities at scale.

        # from groq import GroqAPI
        # # Initialize Groq API client
        # groq_client = GroqAPI(api_key="your-groq-api-key")
        # # Query the database with a new vector for similarity search
        # query_vector = model.encode(["Find similar sentences."])[0]
        # results = groq_client.query_vector_database(index_name="example-index", vector=query_vector)
        # print(results)
        # # Output: List of most similar vectors/documents

    return(stuff)


def create_embedding_model(corpus):

    # perplexity
    # creating an embedding model from scratch involves several steps, including preparing the data, 
    # designing the model architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance. Below is 
    # a detailed guide based on the provided search results:

    # 1. Prepare the Dataset The first step is to gather and preprocess the dataset that will be used 
    # to train the embedding model.

        # from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
        # from nltk.corpus import stopwords
        # import string

        # # Example corpus
        # corpus = ["This is an example sentence.", "Another sentence for training."]

        # # Preprocess the corpus
        # stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
        # processed_corpus = []
        # for sentence in corpus:
            # tokens = word_tokenize(sentence.lower())
            # tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words and word not in string.punctuation]
            # processed_corpus.append(tokens)
        # print(processed_corpus)
        # # Output: [['example', 'sentence'], ['another', 'sentence', 'training']]

    from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
    from nltk.corpus import stopwords
    import string

    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))  # Load NLTK's stop words
    
    processed_corpus = []
    for sentence in corpus:
        tokens = word_tokenize(sentence.lower())
        tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in stop_words and word not in string.punctuation]
        processed_corpus.append(tokens)

    #print(processed_corpus)

    # 2. Load or Train a Word2Vec Model
    from numpy import triu  # <---  the current scipy omits 'triu'
    # #This works because NumPy provides a similar `triu` function.
    from gensim.models import Word2Vec

    model = Word2Vec(
        sentences=processed_corpus,
        size=200,     # Dimensionality of word vectors
        window=10,           # Context window size
        min_count=3,         # Ignore words with frequency <3
        workers=4,           # Number of worker threads
        sg=1,                # Skip-Gram model (set to 0 for CBOW)
        negative=10,         # Negative sampling rate
        sample=1e-4          # Subsampling rate for frequent words
    )

    # 3. compute Sentence Vectors
    # to compare sentences, aggregate word vectors into a single vector for each sentence. 
    # common methods include:
	# Averaging: Take the mean of all word vectors in the sentence.
	# Weighted Averaging: Weight each word vector based on its importance (e.g., TF-IDF).
    # example using averaging: 

    def get_sentence_vector(sentence, model):
        # Filter out words not in the vocabulary
        valid_words = [word for word in sentence if word in model.wv]
    
        # If no valid words are found, return a zero vector
        if not valid_words:
            return [0] * model.vector_size
    
        # Compute the average of word vectors
        sentence_vector = sum(model.wv[word] for word in valid_words) / len(valid_words)
        return sentence_vector

    #  Compute vectors for all sentences
    sentence_vectors = [get_sentence_vector(sentence, model) for sentence in processed_corpus]

    # Print results
    for i, vec in enumerate(sentence_vectors):
        print(f"sentence {i+1} vector:\n{vec}\n")

   


    # 4. Compare Sentences Using Similarity Metrics
    # Use similarity metrics like cosine similarity to compare vectors.

    # Compute pairwise similarities

    # Function to compute cosine similarity manually
    def cosine_similarity_manual(vec1, vec2):
        # Dot product of two vectors
        dot_product = sum(a * b for a, b in zip(vec1, vec2))
    
        # Magnitude (length) of each vector
        magnitude_vec1 = sqrt(sum(a * a for a in vec1))
        magnitude_vec2 = sqrt(sum(b * b for b in vec2))
    
        # Avoid division by zero
        if magnitude_vec1 == 0 or magnitude_vec2 == 0:
            return 0.0
    
        # Compute cosine similarity
        return dot_product / (magnitude_vec1 * magnitude_vec2)

    similarities = cosine_similarity_manual(sentence_vectors)
    # This will output a similarity matrix where `similaritiesij` represents the 
    # similarity between sentence `i` and sentence `j`.
    print(similarities)

    # Advanced Techniques : for more accurate comparisons:
	# use Smooth Inverse Frequency (SIF) weighting to improve sentence embeddings ().
	# consider alternatives like Doc2Vec or pre-trained models like Universal Sentence Encoder or BERT 
    # for better semantic representation ().
